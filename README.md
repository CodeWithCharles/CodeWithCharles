Hello,

I'm Charles POULAIN, back-end developer. I've tried a lot of different things which I upload there. I define myself as a self taught developer. I really enjoy programming in all of its shapes, and that's a real passion to me.

What I have worked with until now  :

- Node JS
- PHP - Symfony
- C# - WPF
- Python
- Java (I created some mods and minecraft plugins)
- Arduino
- MySQL - SQL - T-SQL etc.

I am currently trying to discord the huge iceberg of Neural Network and Deep Learning with Python.

How to contact me :
