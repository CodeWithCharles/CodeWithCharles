Hello,

I'm Charles POULAIN, and I'm a developer. I'm not yet specialized in a specific technology, but I have tried a lot of things. I define myself as a self taught developer. I really enjoy programming in all of its shapes, and that's a real passion to me.

What did I worked with until now  :

- HTML-CSS
- JavaScript - jQuery - Node JS
- PHP - Symfony
- C# - WPF
- Python (Flask and data analysis)
- Lua (Using the minecraft mod called OpenComputer. I did a python server on a Ovh VPS, and used it to communicate with my in-game computers to control systems)
- Java (I created some mods and minecraft plugins)
- Arduino
- MySQL - SQL Server - SQL - T-SQL - Meurise - PhpMyAdmin...

Currently I would like to learn more about Docker and Kubernetes. I have more of a back-end profile.

How to contact me :
