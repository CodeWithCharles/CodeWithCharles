Let me introduce myself :

Hi,

I'm Charles POULAIN, student in IT Development. I'm not yet specialized in a specific technology, but I have tried a lot of things. I did one and a half year of BTS SIO with the SLAM option at la Chataigneraie technic highschool. I really love programming in all of its shapes, and that's a real passion to me.

What did I worked with until now (Keep in mind, I'm not an expert) :

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (No framework or jQuery, only raw JavaScript)
- PHP (Symfony, a bit of Laravel)
- C#
- C++ (Basics, I did some exercices on https://www.hackerrank.com/, but mostly algorithm)
- Python (Same as C++)
- Flutter
- Lua (Using the minecraft mod called OpenComputer. I did a python server on a Ovh VPS, and used it to communicate with my in-game computers to control systems)
- Java (I created some mods and minecraft plugins)
- Node JS (I realized a discord bot for a roleplay community)
- Arduino
- VBA
- MySQL - SQL Server - SQL - T-SQL - Meurise - PhpMyAdmin...

As you can see, lots of things.

What I'm currently learning :

React Native is the next thing I'd like to learn.
